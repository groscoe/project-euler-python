# project-euler-python
Solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) problems in python 3. Wherever possible, I tried to use typing annotations from the [typing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html) module (statically verifiable with [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/)) as well as provide a na√Øve or brute-force solution alongside a more reasoned one.
